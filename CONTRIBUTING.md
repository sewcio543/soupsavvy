### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the project. Use the `black` code formatter to ensure consistent formatting with version specified in `requirements-dev.txt`. To ensure the format is correct, run:

  ```bash
  make format
  ```

  or:

  ```bash
  python -m black . --diff --check
  ```

- Use `flake8` to check for linting issues. To run the linter, use:

  ```bash
  make lint
  ```

  or:

  ```bash
   python -m flake8 --config tox.ini
   ```

- Ensure that your code is well-formatted and follows Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 guidelines.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.

### Testing

- Run the test suite to ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality. You can run the tests using:

  ```bash
  make test
  ```

  or:

  ```bash
  python -m pytest
  ```

- Write new tests for any new features or bug fixes. Test are located in `tests` directory, that should mirror the structure of the `soupsavvy` package.
- Make sure that all tests pass before submitting your pull request.
- Make sure every new line of code is covered by tests. Run `coverage` with:

  ```bash
  make coverage
  ```

  or:

  ```bash
   python -m coverage run -m pytest
   python -m coverage report
   python -m coverage html
  ```

- Ensure that package is installed correctly after new changes:

  ```bash
  make install
  ```

  or:

  ```bash
   python -m pip install -e .
   python -m pip show soupsavvy
  ```

- Check if type hints are defined correctly for your changes:

  ```bash
  make typecheck
  ```

  or:

  ```bash
   python -m mypy . || true
   python -m mypy --install-types --non-interactive
   python -m mypy . --ignore-missing-imports
  ```

### Documentation

- Update the documentation to reflect any changes or new features introduced.
- Ensure that your documentation is clear and provides helpful information for users and other contributors.
- Ensure the documentation builds properly after applying any changes to code or documentation setup:

    ```bash
    make docu
    ```

   or:

   ```bash
   bash docs/sphinx_run.sh
   git clean -fd docs/source/*.rst
   ```

### Demos
