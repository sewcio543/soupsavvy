class RelativeSelector(SoupSelector):
    """
    Base class for relative selectors, that are used to find tags relative
    to the tag that is being searched, which is considered an anchor.

    CSS definition of relative selectors states that it is a selector representing
    an element relative to one or more anchor elements preceded by a combinator.

    In this use case, the anchor element is the tag that is being searched, and
    the combinator is the logic of specific relative selector that is used.

    Example
    -------
    >>> selector = Anchor > TypeSelector("div")
    >>> selector.find_all(tag)

    Uses RelativeChild selector to find any div tag that is a direct child of the
    tag that is being searched (passed as an argument).

    In css such selectors can be used in :has pseudo-class, where selector
    is anchored to the element:

    Example
    -------
    >>> div:has(> a, + p)

    Selects any div tag that has a direct child 'a' tag or a next sibling 'p' tag.

class _Anchor:

    Anchor components is a way to create relative selectors in a more
    readable way by using operators.

    _Anchor is an internal class and it's advisable to use the Anchor
    instance instead, which can be considered like a singleton.

    Component supports the following operators:
    * `>`: RelativeChild

    Example
    -------
    >>> Anchor > TypeSelector("div")

    Creates a RelativeChild selector, that selects any div tag that is a direct
    child of the tag that is being searched.

    * `>>`: RelativeDescendant

    Example
    -------
    >>> Anchor >> TypeSelector("div")

    Creates a RelativeDescendant selector, that selects any div tag that is a descendant
    of the tag that is being searched. This is default behavior of selectors,
    and is equivalent to using the TypeSelector directly, but is implemented
    for the sake of consistency.

    * `+`: RelativeNextSibling

    Example
    -------
    >>> Anchor + TypeSelector("div")

    Creates a RelativeNextSibling selector, that selects any div tag that is next
    sibling of the tag that is being searched, it can logically return at most one tag.

    * `*`: RelativeSubsequentSibling

    Example
    -------
    >>> Anchor * TypeSelector("div")

    Creates a RelativeSubsequentSibling selector, that selects any div tag
    that is a subsequent sibling of the tag that is being searched.

    This imitates css selector relative selectors that are used for example in
    :has pseudo-class, that accepts relative selector list as an argument.

    Example
    -------
    >>> :has(> div, + a)

    This translated to soupsavvy would be:

    Example
    -------
    >>> HasSelector(Anchor > TypeSelector("div"), Anchor + TypeSelector("a"))

    Which would match any tag that has a direct child 'div' and a next sibling 'a' tag.
    Selected tag is the anchor tag that is being searched.

class HasSelector(CompositeSoupSelector):
    """
    Class representing elements selected with respect to matching reference elements.
    Element is selected if any of the provided selectors matched reference element.

    Example
    -------
    >>> HasSelector(TypeSelector("div"))

    matches all elements that have any descendant with "div" tag name.
    It uses default combinator of relative selector, which is descendant.

    Example
    -------
    >>> <span><div>Hello World</div></span> ✔️
    >>> <span><a>Hello World</a></span> ❌

    Other relative selectors can be used with Anchor element.

    Example
    -------
    >>> from soupsavvy.tags.relative import Anchor
    >>> HasSelector(Anchor > TypeSelector("div"))
    >>> HasSelector(Anchor + TypeSelector("div"))

    or by using RelativeSelector components directly:

    Example
    -------
    >>> from soupsavvy.tags.relative import RelativeChild, RelativeNextSibling
    >>> HasSelector(RelativeChild(TypeSelector("div")))
    >>> HasSelector(RelativeNextSibling(TypeSelector("div"))

    Example
    -------
    >>> <span><div>Hello World</div></span> ✔️
    >>> <span><a><div>Hello World</div></a></span> ❌

    In this case, HasSelector is anchored against any element, and matches only elements
    that have "div" tag name as a child.

    Object can be initialized with multiple selectors as well, in which case
    at least one selector must match for element to be included in the result.

    This is an equivalent of CSS :has() pseudo-class,
    that represents elements if any of the relative selectors that are passed as an argument
    match at least one element when anchored against this element.

    Example
    -------
    >>> :has(div, a) { color: red; }
    >>> :has(+ div, > a) { color: red; }

    These examples translated to soupsavvy would be:

    Example
    -------
    >>> from soupsavvy.tags.relative import Anchor
    >>> HasSelector(TypeSelector("div"), TypeSelector("a"))
    >>> HasSelector(Anchor + TypeSelector("div"), Anchor > TypeSelector("a"))

    Notes
    -----
    Passing RelativeDescendant selector into HasSelector is equivalent to using
    its selector directly, as descendant combinator is default option.

    Example
    -------
    >>> HasSelector(RelativeDescendant(TypeSelector("div")))
    >>> HasSelector(Anchor > TypeSelector("div"))
    >>> HasSelector(TypeSelector("div"))

    Three of the above examples are equivalent.
