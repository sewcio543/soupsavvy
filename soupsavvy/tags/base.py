    Interface for classes that define tags and provide functionality
    to find them in BeautifulSoup Tags.

    Methods
    -------
    find(tag: Tag, strict: bool = False)
        Finds tag element in BeautifulSoup Tag by wrapping Tag find method
        and passing parameters specific to given tag.
        If strict parameter is set to True and element is not found exception is raised.
        If strict is set to False, which is a default and element is not found
        result of Tag.find is return, which is None.
        Otherwise matching Tag is returned.
    find_all(tag: Tag)
        Finds all tag elements in BeautifulSoup Tag by wrapping Tag find_all method
        and passing parameters specific to given tag.

    Notes
    -----
    To implement SoupSelector interface child class must implement:
    * 'find_all' method that returns a list of matching elements in bs4.Tag.
    It could optionally implement:
    * '_find' method that returns result of bs4.Tag 'find' method.
    By default '_find' method is implemented by calling 'find_all' method
    and returning first element if any found or None otherwise.
    If different logic is required or performance can be improved, '_find' method
    can be overridden in child class.
