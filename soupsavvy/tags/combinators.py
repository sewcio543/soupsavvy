"""
Module for combinators defined in css.

They they combine other selectors in a way that gives them a useful relationship
to each other and the location of content in the document.

Soupsavvy provides combinators that are used to combine multiple SoupSelector
objects in a similar fashion to CSS combinators.

Classes
-------
ChildCombinator - equivalent of CSS child combinator (>)
NextSiblingCombinator - equivalent of CSS adjacent sibling combinator (+)
SubsequentSiblingCombinator - equivalent of CSS general sibling combinator (*)
DescentCombinator - equivalent of CSS descendant combinator (" ")
SelectorList - equivalent of CSS selector list (,) or :is() pseudo-class

Notes
-----

    Example
    -------

    >>> <div class="widget"><span></span><a>Hello World</a></div> ✔️
    >>> <span class="widget"><a>Hello World</a></span> ❌
    >>> <div class="menu"><span>Hello World</span></div> ❌

    Object can be created as well by using greater than operator '>'
    on two SoupSelector objects.

    Example
    -------
    >>> ElementTag("div") > ElementTag("a")

    Which is equivalent to the first example.

    This is an equivalent of CSS child combinator, that matches elements
    that are direct children of a specified element.

    Example
    -------
    >>> div.widget > a { color: red; }

    Class representing a next sibling combinator in CSS selectors.

    Example
    -------
    >>> NextSiblingCombinator(ElementTag("div"), ElementTag("a"))

    matches all 'a' elements that immediately follow 'div' elements,
    it means that both elements are children of the same parent element.

    Example
    -------
    >>> <div class="widget"></div><a>Hello World</a> ✔️
    >>> <div class="widget"><a>Hello World</a></div> ❌
    >>> <div class="widget"></div><span></span><a>Hello World</a> ❌

    Object can be created as well by using plus operator '+'

    Example
    -------
    >>> div + a { color: red; }

    Which translated to soupsavvy would be:

    Example
    -------

    Notes
    -----

class SubsequentSiblingCombinator(BaseCombinator):
    """
    Class representing a subsequent sibling combinator in CSS selectors.
    Subsequent sibling combinator separates two selectors
    and matches all instances of the second element that follow the first element
    (not necessarily immediately) and share the same parent element.

    Example
    -------
    >>> SubsequentSiblingCombinator(ElementTag("div"), ElementTag("a"))

    matches all 'a' elements that follow 'div' elements.

    Example
    -------
    >>> <div class="widget"></div><a>Hello World</a> ✔️
    >>> <div class="widget"><span></span><a>Hello World</a></div> ✔️
    >>> <span class="widget"><a>Hello World</a></span> ❌
    >>> <a>Hello World</a><div class="menu"></div> ❌

    Object can be created as well by using multiplication operator '*'
    on two SoupSelector objects, due to the lack of support for '~' operator
    between two operands.

    Example
    -------
    >>> div ~ a { color: red; }

    Which translated to soupsavvy would be:

    Example
    -------
    >>> ElementTag("div") * ElementTag("a")

class DescendantCombinator(BaseCombinator):
    """
    Class representing a descent combinator in CSS selectors.
    Descent combinator separates two selectors and matches all instances
    of the second element that are descendants of the first element.

    Two SoupSelector objects are required to create DescentCombinator,
    but more can be provided as positional arguments, which binds them
    in a sequence of steps to match.

    Example
    -------
    >>> DescentCombinator(
    >>>     ElementTag("div", [AttributeTag(name="class", value="menu")]),
    >>>     ElementTag("a", [AttributeTag(name="href", value="google", re=True)])
    >>> )

    matches all descendants of 'div' element with 'menu' class attribute
    that are 'a' elements with href attribute containing 'google'.

    Example
    -------
    >>> <div class="menu"><a href="google.com"></a></div> ✔️
    >>> <div class="menu"><div><a href="google.com"></a></div></div> ✔️
    >>> <div class="menu"><a href="duckduckgo.com"></a></div> ❌
    >>> <div class="widget"><a href="google.com"></a></div> ❌
    >>> <a href="google.com"></a> ❌
    >>> <div class="widget"></div> ❌

    Object can be created as well by using right shift operator '>>'
    on two SoupSelector objects.

    Example
    -------
    >>> div a { color: red; }

    Which translated to soupsavvy would be:

    Example
    -------
    >>> ElementTag("div") >> ElementTag("a")

class SelectorList(MultipleSoupSelector):
    """
    Class representing a list of selectors in CSS,
    a selector list is a comma-separated list of selectors,
    that selects all the matching nodes.

    Class represents an Union of multiple soup selectors.
    Provides elements matching any of the selectors in an Union.

    At least two SoupSelector objects are required to create SelectorList,
    but more can be provided as positional arguments.

    Example
    -------
    >>> SelectorList(
    >>>     ElementTag("a"),
    >>>     ElementTag("div", [AttributeTag(name="class", value="widget")])
    >>> )

    matches all elements that have "a" tag name OR 'class' attribute "widget".

    Example
    -------
    >>> <a>Hello World</a> ✔️
    >>> <div class="widget">Hello World</div> ✔️
    >>> <div>Hello Python</div> ❌

    This is an equivalent of CSS comma selector (selector list) or :is() selector.

    Example
    -------
    >>> h1, h1 { color: red;}
    >>> :is(h1, h2) { color: red; }

    This example translated to soupsavvy would be:

    Example
    -------
    >>> SoupUnionTag(ElementTag("h1"), ElementTag("h2"))
    >>> ElementTag("h1") | ElementTag("h2")

    Object can be created as well by using bitwise OR operator '|'
    on two SoupSelector objects.

    Example
    -------
    >>> ElementTag(tag="a") | ElementTag("div", [AttributeTag(name="class", value="widget")])

    Which is equivalent to the first example.

    Notes
    -----
    This Combinator does not inherit from BaseCombinator,
    as its logic differs from other combinators.
