"""
Module for css selectors API and not only.
Imitate css some pseudo-classes behavior done on soupsavvy selectors.

Contains:

* is_: function to create SelectorList from list of selectors
* where: alias for is_, no difference in behavior in scraping context
* not_: function to create NotSelector from list of selectors
* and_: function to create AndSelector from list of selectors
* has: function to create HasSelector from list of selectors

There is not similar functionality in css for AndSelector expect for selector concatenation,
and_ is more to have and alternative way to create AndSelector for soupsavvy selectors.

These utils do not brings extra functionality into the package, but they can be
used for convenience and readability in some cases.

    """
    Returns an union of multiple soup selectors.
    Provides elements matching any of the selectors in the union.

    Parameters
    ----------
    selectors: SoupSelector
        SoupSelector objects to match accepted as positional arguments.
        At least two objects are required per SelectorList class requirements.

    Example
    -------
    >>> is_(ElementTag("h1"), ElementTag("h2"))
    >>> where(ElementTag("h1"), ElementTag("h2"))

    This is an equivalent of CSS comma selector (selector list) or :is() selector.
    Function is also aliased by 'where' function that imitate css :where pseudo-class.
    In css the main difference is their specificity, but in this context they are the same.

    Example
    -------
    >>> h1, h1 { color: red;}
    >>> :is(h1, h2) { color: red; }
    >>> :where(h1, h2) { color: red; }

    Returns an negation of multiple soup selectors.
    NotSelector represents elements that do not match a list of selectors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    selectors: SoupSelector
        SoupSelector objects to negate match accepted as positional arguments.

    Example
    -------
    >>> not_(TagSelector(tag="div"), TagSelector(tag="a"))

    This is an equivalent of CSS :not() negation pseudo-class,

    Returns HasSelector whose behavior imitate css :has() pseudo-class,

    Parameters
    ----------
    selectors: SoupSelector
        SoupSelector objects to match accepted as positional arguments.
        At least two objects are required per AndSelector class requirements.
